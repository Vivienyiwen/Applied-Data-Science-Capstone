# Winning Space Race with Data Science Project

Xiong Yiwen

## 1. Introduction

### Project background and context:

The era of commercial space has arrived, and there are several companies that are making space travel affordable for everyone. Perhaps the most successful of them is SpaceX, and one of the reasons is that their rocket launch is relatively inexpensive.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Problems I want to find answers:
Correlations between each rocket variables and successful landing rate
Conditions to get the best results and ensure the best successful landing rate

## 2. Conclusion

As the number of flights increased, the success rate increased, and recently it has exceeded 80%.

Orbital types SSO, HEO, GEO, and ES-L1 have the highest success rate (100%).

The launch site is close to railways, highways, and coastline, but far from cities.

KSLC-39A has the highest number of launch successes and the highest success rate among all sites.

The launch success rate of low weighted payloads is higher than that of heavy weighted payloads.

In this dataset, all models have the same accuracy (83.33%), but it seems that more data is needed to determine the optimal model due to the small data size.
